ADDvisor: An ADHD Planner/Scheduling application.
This is a simple scheduling app aimed towards assisting those with ADHD. 
This is done so with:
  -A planner/task page that allows the user to schedule tasks and rank them based on priority. These tasks will then be color coated based on that priority when displayed on the calendar. 
    (Priority: 1 = Blue, 2 = Green, 3 = Yellow, 4 = Orange, 5 = Red)
    
  -Habit tracker that allow the user to mark down habits they wish to form. The user can then mark off these habits once they have completed them

  -Medication tracker that allows the user to enter in the medication they need to take in either the AM section or PM section. Then the user can mark off once they have taken them. These will be reset and marked as not taken after each day

  -(Yet to be implemented) Symptom tracker that allow the user to mark down any symptoms they may be feeling and mark down the severity they are currently feeling

  -(Yet to be implemented) Notes/Journal section. Allow the user to write down any notes or simply things they wish to remember later

These functions can be found on other applications, but never found all in one app. Our goal is to consolidate these functions into one package. 

Our system requires an email and for the user to create a password with at least 8 characters, an uppercase, a number, and a special character
